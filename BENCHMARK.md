# Benchmarking

## Summary

`cargo xtask bench` runs identical DuckLake workloads against
three metadata catalogs — moraine's SlateDB store, a stock DuckDB-file
catalog, and a stock Postgres catalog — through the same pinned DuckDB CLI,
and reports per-workload wall-clock timings side by side. The data layer is
Parquet under a local `DATA_PATH` in every configuration; only the catalog
backend varies, so differences isolate metadata-path cost — the thing moraine
replaces.

## Goals

- One command produces a comparable table: workload × backend, median over
  repeats, with min/max spread.
- Every backend runs the byte-identical SQL statement stream through the same
  DuckDB binary, so numbers differ only by catalog backend.
- Workloads cover both catalog-dominated paths (many small commits, DDL,
  attach, snapshot listing, maintenance) and data-dominated paths (bulk load,
  scans) — the latter as a sanity check that the data plane is unaffected.
- The Postgres backend self-provisions when Postgres binaries are on the
  machine and degrades to a skip (with a notice) when they are not; the suite
  never fails because a backend is unavailable.
- Non-goals: concurrency/contention benchmarks, remote object stores,
  cross-machine reproducibility, statistical rigor beyond median/min/max, and
  CI execution (the suite is a local tool; CI keeps running `e2e`).

## Design

### Command surface

```text
cargo xtask bench [--backends moraine,duckdb,postgres]
                  [--workloads <name>,...]
                  [--scale small|medium|large]
                  [--repeat N]
```

Defaults: all backends (Postgres skipped with a notice if unavailable), all
workloads, `--scale small`, `--repeat 3`. `bench` reuses `e2e`'s plumbing: it
downloads/caches the pinned DuckDB CLI, builds and packages the
`moraine_duckdb` extension, and caches `INSTALL ducklake` / `INSTALL postgres`
artifacts under `target/duckdb-extensions/`.

### Backends

Each backend is an `ATTACH` recipe over a fresh per-run directory; everything
else in the session is shared.

- `moraine` — `ATTACH 'ducklake:moraine:<store_dir>' (DATA_PATH '<data_dir>')`
  after `LOAD`ing the packaged extension. SlateDB over the local filesystem.
  moraine's per-commit latency is bounded by its WAL flush cadence (100ms by
  default); `META_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS <n>` on the attach tunes it, at the cost
  of more frequent object-store PUTs.
- `duckdb` — `ATTACH 'ducklake:<dir>/meta.ducklake' (DATA_PATH '<data_dir>')`.
  The stock, all-files DuckLake.
- `postgres` — `ATTACH 'ducklake:postgres:dbname=<db> host=<socket_dir>
  port=<port>' (DATA_PATH '<data_dir>')`. The harness provisions an ephemeral
  cluster per bench run: `initdb` into a temp dir, `pg_ctl start` listening
  only on a Unix socket (no TCP), one database per (workload, repeat), stock
  configuration, `pg_ctl stop` on exit (including on failure, via a drop
  guard). Binary discovery: `$PATH` first, then the newest
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@*/bin`. `MORAINE_BENCH_POSTGRES=<libpq DSN>`
  overrides provisioning and points at an existing server (the harness then
  creates and drops its scratch databases there). If neither is available the
  backend reports `skipped`.

The moraine extension is `LOAD`ed in every session — including stock ones —
so session preambles are identical across backends.

### Timing mechanics

One CLI process per (backend, workload, repeat), fed a script on stdin:

```text
.timer on
<statement 1>;
<statement 2>;
...
```

With `.timer on`, the CLI prints `Run Time (s): real R user U sys S` after
every SQL statement, in statement order; dot-commands print none. The harness
builds each workload as an ordered list of statements, each tagged with a
phase label or `setup`, then zips the `Run Time` lines with the SQL statements
by index. A phase's time is the sum of its statements' `real` values; `setup`
statements are executed but not reported. A count mismatch between statements
and `Run Time` lines is a hard error, not a partial report.

Process start-up, extension loading, and fixture seeding are thus excluded;
`ATTACH` itself is a timed statement so catalog-open cost is a first-class
phase. The first statement in a session absorbs some one-time initialization,
so every session opens with a throwaway `SELECT 1` tagged `setup`. Threads
are left at DuckDB's default; both sides of every comparison share it.

Workloads that measure reads against pre-existing state get two sessions: an
untimed seeding session (same backend, same directories), then the measured
session — so the measured `ATTACH` is a genuinely cold open over a populated
catalog.

### Workloads

Scales: `small` / `medium` / `large` set (bulk rows N, small commits K,
tables T) to (100k, 20, 10) / (1M, 50, 25) / (10M, 200, 100).

- `bulk_load` — `CREATE TABLE` + one `INSERT … FROM range(N)`. Phases:
  `attach`, `create_table`, `insert`. Data-plane dominated.
- `small_commits` — K autocommitted single-row `INSERT`s into one table.
  Phases: `attach`, `inserts` (sum of K). The headline catalog-latency
  number; also reported per-commit in the table.
- `many_tables` — T × `CREATE TABLE`. Phases: `attach`, `creates`. DDL
  commit path.
- `scan` — seeded with the `bulk_load` shape, then measured: `attach`,
  `full_scan` (`SELECT sum(...)`), `filtered_scan` (`WHERE id = N/2`),
  `time_travel` (`AT (VERSION => 1)` count), `snapshots`
  (`SELECT count(*) FROM ducklake_snapshots('lake')`).
- `maintenance` — seeded with K small commits, then measured: `attach`,
  `merge` (`CALL ducklake_merge_adjacent_files('lake')`), `expire`
  (`CALL ducklake_expire_snapshots('lake', older_than => now())`), `cleanup`
  (`CALL ducklake_cleanup_old_files('lake', cleanup_all => true)`).

Every (workload, repeat) runs in fresh directories (and, for Postgres, a
fresh database) so repeats are independent; the report is the median across
repeats with min/max.

### Report

Stdout gets one aligned table: rows are `workload/phase`, columns are
backends, cells are `median (min…max)` in adaptive units (µs/ms/s), plus a
`×` ratio column relative to `moraine` where both ran. The same data is
written as JSON to `target/bench/report.json` (schema: run metadata —
date-free machine facts like scale, repeat, backend versions — then
`results[{workload, phase, backend, seconds: [per repeat]}]`), for diffing
across checkouts.

### Structure

`xtask` splits into `main.rs` (dispatch), `e2e.rs`, `duckdb.rs` (shared CLI
download/build/packaging helpers), and `bench.rs` with `bench/` submodules
(`backends.rs`, `workloads.rs`, `timing.rs`, `report.rs`). Timer-line
parsing, statement/phase zipping, statistics, and table formatting are pure
functions with unit tests.
